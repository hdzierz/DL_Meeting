# Background

* Researchers complain about gene annotation
* Manual annottaion project generated a long list of "correct" gene annotations
* We want to bring neural networks to PFR vreeding
* Ling term view is to produce models that can support breeding decision making
* Long term view is to work with variant data to predict trait(s distributions)
* Make annotation better (do we need an NN?)

# Steps

* QC on and collection of data
* Proof of concept
 * Detect gene
 * Edge detection
* Unspervised learning?

---

# Step one detection
